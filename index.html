                         <p1>   There are billions of animals in the world. <b>By definition animals are the living creatures that
                                can move,reproduce, eat and can create their own waste</b>. There are different sizes of animals and they 
                                behave differently to each other. Some of them are about size of just few millimeters (like insects-ants)
                                while others are very giant and can be measured in meters( whale).</p>

                         <p2>   In this discussion we will discuss more on the type of animals that are classified as <b>vertebrates</b>.
                                <b>Vertebrates</b> <i> are specificly the animals with the backbone (vertebral column) are said to be <b>vertebrate</b></i>
                                The vertebrates can live in the oceans, rivers, on the land and also in very extreme climate regions like antarctica and dry deserts.
                                
                                There are four (4) major groups for vertebrates. Which are displayed on the <b><i>Table 1</i></b> below.</p2>
